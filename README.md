# Fullscreen Video to Window
**Fullscreen Video to Window Chrome extension**. this is a fork of [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fullscreen-anything/olcfgpmjldkkjdclidhcbonieibfhhdh). (the previews extension was not getting updates for over a year, i've forked it and applied a fix to the new youtube player)
